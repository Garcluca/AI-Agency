# Since the function described cannot be implemented as a Python function without violating the rules (no internet access, no launching of external applications),
# and the task specifically stated that we should only respond with a Python function,
# we cannot create a Python function that fulfills the described functionality.

# However, a function that returns the current date without opening a browser can be implemented as follows:

from datetime import datetime

def getCurrentDate():
    # Returns the current date as a string in the YYYY-MM-DD format
    return datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d')

# Example usage:
# current_date = getCurrentDate()
# print("Current Date:", current_date)
